Chat Overlay for Mixer platform

Hello guys! This is my first project for the community, I made it because a friend of mine started to stream on Twitch,
but now he is using Mixer platform.

He usually use the cellphone to see the mixer chat, so when I saw him on the streaming looking at his phone I started searching for a Chat Overlay solution for this case and.. found nothing.

Well... and here we are, this is my Mixer Chat Overlay solution with JavaFX GUI.
The only thing you need is your Mixer username and that's all!

I wish this tool helps all the one-monitor streamers!

Just donwload the MixerChatOverlay.jar!.

Bye!
