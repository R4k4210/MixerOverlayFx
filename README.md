Chat Overlay for Mixer platform

Hello guys! This is my first proyect for the community, I made it because a friend of mine start streaming on Twitch,
and then he goes to Mixer platform.

He usually use the cellphone to see the mixer chat, so when I see it on the stream looking at the phone I start searching
a Chat Overlay solution for this cases and.. found nothing.

Well... and we are here, this is my Mixer Chat Overlay solution with JavaFX GUI.
The only thing you need is a streamer username, and that's all!

I wish this tool helps all the one-monitor streamers!

Just donwload the .zip and extract it, then double click con MixerChatOverlay.java.
